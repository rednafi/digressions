<p>Although Medium has been adopted by numerous technical writers and publications, it wasn’t necessarily built targeting this group and doesn’t consider them as first class citizens of the platform. I primarily write about Python, data science, software development and infosec in general. There’re multiple pain points that eventually forced me to steer away from Medium and look for better alternatives. First, It doesn’t support markdown syntax and the bare-bone formatting tools can get in the way of writing contents that have code snippets or require custom formatting. Secondly, there’s no built-in support for code syntax highlighting and you have to embed your code snippets as github gists. Managing and maintaining all these random gists can be a lot of work if you have many sizeable works that contain code snippets. Also, there’s no proper support for Latex syntax to render mathematical equations. That’s a huge deal breaker for me since many of my Data Science blogs use mathematical equations to explain disparate concepts. Usually, you get around this by converting the equations to images and embedding them in the blogs. But it completely borks mobile device readability. Another thing is that you don’t control your contents in any way, Medium hosts and manages your content for you which can save</p>
