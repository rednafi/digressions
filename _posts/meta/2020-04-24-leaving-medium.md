I picked up Medium for dumping my thoughts and processes immediately after I discovered it back in 2016 and up until very recently, it has served me quite well. It tries to solve a few fundamental issues with any form of online content writing and does a fairly good job in doing so. It's extremely easy to fire up medium's built-in editor and just start writing. There is nothing to install or configure as everything is embedded into their website. The formatting tools are not fancy but adequate and the process of publishing involves merely adding a few tags and hitting the designated button. This reduction of friction usually means less focus on formatting, deployment, hosting and more focus on the actual writing. May be that's why people outside of the tech sphere have embraced the platform wholeheartedly. Also, the platform has fantastic SEO and no matter what you are writing about, it's almost guaranteed to garner a few eyeballs around it. There are a number publications dedicated to different topics and this makes the process of building up an audience even easier. However, the good stuffs probably end there.


Although Medium has been adopted by numerous technical writers and publications, it wasn't necessarily built targeting this group and don't consider them as first class citizens of the platform. I primarily write about Python, data science, software development and infosec in general. There were multiple pain points that eventually forced me to steer away from Medium and look for better alternatives. It doesn't support markdown syntax and the bare-bone formatting tools can get in the way of writing contents that have code snippets or require custom formatting. Moreover, there's no built-in support for code syntax highlighting and you have to embed your code snippets as github gists. Managing and maintaining all these random gists can be a lot of work if you have a sizeable amount of writings that contain code snippets. Also, there's no proper support for Latex syntax to render mathematical equations. That's a huge deal breaker for me since many of my Data Science related blogs need mathematical equation to explain stuff. Usually, you get around this by converting the equations to images and embedding them in the blogs. But it completely borks mobile device readability.
