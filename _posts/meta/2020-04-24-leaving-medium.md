I picked up Medium for dumping my thoughts and processes immediately after I discovered it back in 2016 and up until very recently, it has served me quite well. It tries to solve a few fundamental issues with any form of online content writing and does a fairly good job in doing so. It's extremely easy to fire up medium's built-in editor and just start writing. There is nothing to install or configure as everything is embedded into their website. The formatting tools are not fancy but adequate and the process of publishing involves merely adding a few tags and hitting the designated button. This reduction of friction usually means less focus on formatting, deployment, hosting and more focus on the actual writing. May be that's why people outside of the tech sphere have embraced the platform wholeheartedly. Also, the platform has fantastic SEO and no matter what you are writing about, it is almost guaranteed to garner a few eyeballs around it. There are a number publications dedicated to different topics and this building up an audience even easier. However, the good stuffs probably end there.


Although Medium has been adopted by numerous technical writers and publications, it wasn't necessary built targeting this group initially since they don't regard them as first class citizens of the platform. I primarily write about Python, data science, software development and infosec in general. There are multiple pain points that eventually forced me to steer away from Medium and look for better alternatives. There is no support for markdown syntax and the bare-bone formatting tools can get in the way of writing content that has code snippets and needs custom formatting. Moreover, there is no built-in support for code syntax highlighting and you have to embed your code snippets as github gists. Changing and managing all these random github gists can be a lot of hassle if you have a sizable of contents there.
