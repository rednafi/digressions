I picked up Medium for dumping my thoughts and processes immediately after I discovered it back in 2016 and up until very recently, it has served me quite well. It tries to solve a few fundamental issues with any form of online content writing and does a fairly good job in doing so. It's extremely easy to fire up medium's built-in editor and just start writing. There is nothing to install or configure as everything is embedded into their website. The formatting tools are not fancy but adequate and the process of publishing involves merely adding a few tags and hitting the designated button. This reduction of friction usually means less focus on formatting, deployment, hosting and more focus on the actual writing. Also, the platform has fantastic SEO and no matter what you are writing about, it is guaranteed to garner a few eyeballs around it. There are multiple publications dedicated to different topics and building up an audience has never been easier. However, the good stuffs probably end there.
